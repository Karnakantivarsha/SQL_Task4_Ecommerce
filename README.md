# üõí SQL Task 4 ‚Äì E-commerce (Online Retail) Data Analysis  

## üìò Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing an **E-commerce (Online Retail)** dataset using **SQL** and **Python (Google Colab)**.  
We use SQL queries to explore sales trends, customer behavior, and top-performing products.  
The goal is to demonstrate SQL-based analytics using **SQLite** without needing any external installation.

## üéØ Objectives  
- Load a real-world dataset and store it in an SQLite database  
- Run SQL queries directly from Google Colab  
- Analyze total revenue, customer activity, and sales patterns  
- Generate insights and export results  

---

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies  
- **Google Colab** ‚Äì online notebook to run Python + SQL  
- **SQLite3** ‚Äì lightweight database engine  
- **Pandas** ‚Äì to read, clean, and transfer data to SQL  
- **Kaggle Dataset** ‚Äì ‚ÄúOnline Retail‚Äù

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Implementation  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Dataset in Google Colab
```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()     # Choose "Online Retail.csv"

###2Ô∏è‚É£ Import Required Libraries
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

###3Ô∏è‚É£ Load Dataset
df = pd.read_csv('Online Retail.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-1')
df.head()

###4Ô∏è‚É£ Create SQLite Database
conn = sqlite3.connect('ecommerce.db')
df.to_sql('ecommerce', conn, index=False, if_exists='replace')
print("‚úÖ Database created and table loaded successfully!")

###5Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Data
pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM ecommerce LIMIT 5;", conn)

### SQL Queries (Run Each Using pd.read_sql_query(query, conn))
üîπ Query 1 ‚Äì Display first 10 records
SELECT * FROM ecommerce LIMIT 10;

üîπ Query 2 ‚Äì Total revenue per customer
SELECT CustomerID,
       SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM ecommerce
WHERE CustomerID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY CustomerID
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;

üîπ Query 3 ‚Äì Top 5 countries by revenue
SELECT Country,
       SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM ecommerce
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
LIMIT 5;

üîπ Query 4 ‚Äì Average order value per customer
SELECT CustomerID,
       AVG(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS AvgOrderValue
FROM ecommerce
WHERE CustomerID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY CustomerID
ORDER BY AvgOrderValue DESC
LIMIT 10;

üîπ Query 5 ‚Äì Monthly sales trend
SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', InvoiceDate) AS Month,
       SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS MonthlyRevenue
FROM ecommerce
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month;

üîπ Query 6 ‚Äì Highest-selling products
SELECT Description,
       SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantitySold
FROM ecommerce
GROUP BY Description
ORDER BY TotalQuantitySold DESC
LIMIT 10;

üîπ Query 7 ‚Äì Top customers by number of purchases
SELECT CustomerID,
       COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNo) AS TotalPurchases
FROM ecommerce
WHERE CustomerID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY CustomerID
ORDER BY TotalPurchases DESC
LIMIT 10;

üîπ Query 8 ‚Äì Most frequently purchased products per country
SELECT Country,
       Description,
       SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM ecommerce
GROUP BY Country, Description
ORDER BY Country, TotalQuantity DESC;

üîπ Query 9 ‚Äì Identify cancelled orders (if InvoiceNo starts with ‚ÄúC‚Äù)
SELECT * 
FROM ecommerce
WHERE InvoiceNo LIKE 'C%';

üîπ Query 10 ‚Äì Total quantity and revenue per product category
SELECT Description,
       SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity,
       SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM ecommerce
GROUP BY Description
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
LIMIT 15;

### Exporting Results to CSV
result1 = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM ecommerce LIMIT 10;", conn)
result2 = pd.read_sql_query("""SELECT CustomerID, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
                               FROM ecommerce WHERE CustomerID IS NOT NULL
                               GROUP BY CustomerID ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;""", conn)
result3 = pd.read_sql_query("""SELECT Country, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
                               FROM ecommerce GROUP BY Country ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC LIMIT 5;""", conn)

result1.to_csv('query1_output.csv', index=False)
result2.to_csv('query2_total_revenue.csv', index=False)
result3.to_csv('query3_top_countries.csv', index=False)
print("‚úÖ Query results saved to CSV!")

### Conclusion

The Online Retail dataset clearly shows how SQL and Python together can uncover business insights.
Using Google Colab and SQLite, we can perform data extraction, aggregation, and visualization seamlessly ‚Äî no need to install MySQL locally.
This approach is ideal for students, analysts, and beginners working with limited resources.
